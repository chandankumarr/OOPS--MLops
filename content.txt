 1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab



5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
        here to hide the attribute we use double __ before the attribute
        and to print this we have to give (object._classname__attributename)
    > getter and setter
    > static method

 Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example 
    > Why inheritance is needed? (code reuseability, parent has no access to child class) 
    > what gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods 
    > constructor overloading & method overloading 
    > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)
    > Types of inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybr
